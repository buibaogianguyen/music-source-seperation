# DTTNet Music Source Seperation model

# Research Paper - Music Source Separation Based on a Lightweight Deep Learning Framework (DTTNET: DUAL-PATH TFC-TDF UNET)

This model is a DTTNet deep-learning model based on the 2023 research paper [Music Source Separation Based on a Lightweight Deep Learning Framework (DTTNET: DUAL-PATH TFC-TDF UNET)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684), authored by Junyu Chen, Susmitha Vekkot, and Pancham Shukla. The model takes in a song's audio file and returns two audio files; one consists of the vocals, the other consists of the instrumentals, extracted from the original file.
